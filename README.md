JSON Export for MoneyMoney
==========================

This is a small extension for the macOS application [MoneyMoney](https://moneymoney-app.com).

It allows exporting transaction as JSON files, via the standard `Ums√§tze exportieren` feature.


Installation
------------

See https://moneymoney-app.com/api/export/ for info on how to install this extension.
Basically, you only need to copy the `.lua` file in to the `Extensions` directory underneath `MoneyMoney`'s `Application Support` directory, which - in my case - is located here:

```
/Users/mathias/Library/Containers/com.moneymoney-app.retail/Data/Library/Application Support/MoneyMoney/Extensions
```
